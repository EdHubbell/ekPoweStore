EK Powe Store website

Simple paypal site to allow for orders of all kinds of items from EK Powe.

Maybe some poinsettias, or maybe some t-shirts or whatever.

Poinsettia Summary: 

In the one month this site was active (Oct 22 to Nov 23, 2014), there were 559 pageviews by 185 users.  77% of folks were on a desktop device.

Not sure how many folks actually ordered.

Cost to keep the site up on Azure is about $10 a month.  So it is about time to shut this one down.  Unless it is making $120/year, it is time to kill it.

Facebook share plugin required that we run as a https site.  Don't know why, but it needed that in order to work in FireFox and IE, maybe.  We got maybe 15 or 20 'likes'.  This led to 144 story 'impressions', whatever the hell that means.  I think it means someone on Facebook saw our site based on a friend linking to it.
